## üìñ Abstract

[IFMIF-DONES](https://ifmif-dones.es/) is an experimental facility designed to irradiate material samples under conditions similar to those expected in future fusion power reactors. As a radioactive facility, it requires precise design of specific subsystems to guarantee the protection of the public, plant personnel and environment. This is the case of the Argon Purification Subsystem (ArPS), which is responsible for ensuring the inertization of those rooms with potential presence of liquid Li. However, design decisions regarding purity requirements of such Ar and purification parameters are complex, as many variables must be considered and optimized. To support this design process, a [MELCOR](https://www.sandia.gov/MELCOR/) simulation model of the IFMIF-DONES ArPS has been developed. Using this model, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to study the performance of this subsystem under different configurations. We study how to keep the impurity concentrations of inert rooms stable during a year of operation, in order to minimize the risk of Li reactions while ensuring dynamic confinement and reducing Ar consumption. In addition, the transition between maintenance and operation modes is also considered, analysing the effect of different transition periods and injected Ar inventory.
